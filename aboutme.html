	<h1>The Fresh Prince of Kildare</h1>
	<p>I was once told if Mark Murphy was told to leave the room, he'd take the window instead of the door! At the time of my Leaving Cert I had the choice of becoming a plasterer or do an Arts Degree in the hope of becoming a teacher. I chose the latter and plodded along doing a degree in History and Geography.</p>
	<p>I was always interested in technology so I got a job working for Three as a Retail Salesperson. I did that over 2 years and then did the same in Australia and travelled around. Once I came back to Ireland, I got a job as a Travel Consultant in Trailfinders before moving onto becoming a Corpertate Travel Consultant with Fcm Travel Solutions</p>
	<p>As options are limited in the travel industry in Ireland, I decided a change was needed and reskilled to become a Software Developer. I am willing to take any Graduate or Junior role in an IT company in Ireland or in Europe. My email is murphymark1990@gmail.com if you wish to get in contact with me.</p>
