<h1>Hi there</h1>
<p>My name is Mark Murphy and yes it is the most Irish name you have ever read! I have recently graduated from Maynooth University with a Higher Diploma in Software Development. I received a 1.1 grade in this course, which was basically 3 years worth of Computer Science condesened into a one year conversion course. In this time I discovered a passion for Web Development in particular. In projects I would take the role of Front End developer and occasionally helping out the Back End. I am willing to work almost anywhere in the world and I am adaptable to anything a company might throw at me. Anyway if you've reached this far, take a look around the site, see what you think and if you like what you see email me at murphymark1990@gmail.com</p>
